/*
 * You will define a different constant for each location. These definitions will be in debug.h.
 * The constants should be specified in hex.
 * When you call this routine, you will call it with a defined constant from debug.h – e.g., dbgEvent(DLOC_UART_ISR_BEGIN) and never with something like dbgOutputLoc(0x35).
